    title: "What are Large Language Models?",
    description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that excels at understanding and generating human-like text. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and learn to predict the next word or sequence of words based on context. They have revolutionized natural language processing tasks and are capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text across a wide range of topics.",

    title: "How do Large Language Models work?",
    description: "Large Language Models work by leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These models consist of multiple layers of neurons that process input text in parallel, allowing them to capture complex patterns and relationships in language. During training, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words, and this knowledge is then used to generate text during inference.",
